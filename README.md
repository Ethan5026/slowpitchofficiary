# Flutter App Setup Guide

This guide walks you through installing Flutter, setting up Android and iOS environments, and running a Flutter app on **Android** (emulator or physical device) and **iOS** (physical device).

---

## **1. Install Flutter**

### **Windows - Physical and Emulated Device Testing/Development**
1. Download Flutter from the official site: [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
2. Extract the Flutter SDK to a preferred location (e.g., `C:\flutter` on Windows)
3. Add Flutter to the system path:
  - Windows: Add `C:\flutter\bin` to `Environment Variables`
4. Restart your terminal
5. Download Android Studio from the official site: [Android Studio Download](https://https://developer.android.com/studio)
6. Install the Android Studio Dart and Flutter plugins from Settings --> Plugins
7. For Emulating a Device:
  - Set up a device in the Device Manager tab
  - Edit the device and set `Graphics = Software`
  - Set up the camera environment by going into `Advanced Settings` and set `Front Camera = Emulated` and `Back Camera = Emulated`
8. For Physical Device:
  - Enable **Developer Mode** on your Android phone:
  - Go to **Settings > About phone**
  - Tap **Build number** **7 times** to enable Developer Mode
  - In **Developer Options**, enable **USB Debugging**
  - Connect your Android device via USB
  - Run:
      ```sh
      flutter devices
      ```
    Your device should appear in the list.

**Common Windows Issues:**
- If your device becomes unresponsive with errors about `*.lock files` delete all files ending in `.lock` in your Android Studio installation location within the `avd` directory
- When running the app, if the installation fails due to storage limitations, select to edit your emulated device and select the `Wipe Data` option to clear the device's app storage.
- If Android Studio is unable to run Dart, end all tasks in Task Manager using `dart`. Some programs can be left dangling.

### **MacOS - Physical Device Testing/Development**
1. 1. Install **Xcode** from the App Store
2. Open **Xcode > Preferences > Accounts**
3. Sign in with your Apple ID (free account works, but requires manual app signing)
4. Connect your iPhone via USB
5. Trust the device when prompted
6. Install **Flutter** using Homebrew:
   ```sh
   brew install flutter
   ```
7. Ensure **Xcode** is installed via the App Store
8. Install CocoaPods for iOS dependencies:
   ```sh
   sudo gem install cocoapods
   ```
9. Run:
   ```sh
   flutter devices
   ```
   Your iPhone should appear in the list.
10. Open **ios/Runner.xcworkspace** in Xcode
11. Select your **development team** under **Signing & Capabilities**
12. Run the app in Xcode or via:
    ```sh
    flutter run
    ```
**Common iOS Issues**
- **iOS Signing Issues?**
    - Ensure Xcode is signed with a valid development team in **Signing & Capabilities**.

---

## **2. Verify Installation**
Run the following command to check if Flutter is set up correctly:
```sh
flutter doctor
```
If there are any missing dependencies, follow the instructions provided by `flutter doctor`.

---

## **3. Setup Flutter Project**

Navigate to your project directory and run:
```sh
flutter clean
flutter pub get
```
If `flutter pub get` fails, run it again:
```sh
flutter pub get
```

---

## **4. Running the Flutter App**

To start the app on an **Android emulator, physical Android device, or iOS device**, run:
```sh
flutter run
```
If running on iOS and encountering permission errors, try:
```sh
cd ios
pod install
cd ..
flutter run
```

---

## **Troubleshooting**
- **App not detecting device?**
  - Run `flutter devices` to confirm the device is recognized.
  - Ensure USB debugging (Android) or proper provisioning (iOS) is set up.
- **Errors during `flutter pub get`?**
  - Run `flutter clean` and try `flutter pub get` twice.
- **Dependency Errors**
  - Run `flutter clean` and try `flutter pub get` twice.
- **Camera Not Working?**
  - Ensure camera permissions are granted in the device settings.
- **Model Loading Errors?**
  - Verify the model file paths in the `assets/` directory.
- **iOS Build Issues?**
  - Ensure CocoaPods dependencies are installed and Xcode signing is configured.

## **6. Method Channels**

The plugin uses method channels to communicate between Flutter and the native platforms.

### **Android**
- **Method Channel**: `"ultralytics_yolo"`
  - **Implemented in**: [`UltralyticsYoloPlugin.java`](softball_tracker/ultralytics_yolo/android/src/main/java/com/ultralytics/ultralytics_yolo/UltralyticsYoloPlugin.java)
  - **Key Methods**:
    - `loadModel`: Loads the YOLO model for object detection.
    - `setConfidenceThreshold`: Sets the confidence threshold for detections.
    - `setIouThreshold`: Sets the Intersection over Union (IoU) threshold.
    - `startCamera`: Starts the camera preview.
    - `stopCamera`: Stops the camera preview.

### **iOS**
- **Method Channel**: `"ultralytics_yolo"`
  - **Implemented in**: [`SwiftUltralyticsYoloPlugin.swift`](softball_tracker/ultralytics_yolo/ios/Classes/SwiftUltralyticsYoloPlugin.swift)
  - **Key Methods**:
    - `loadModel`: Loads the YOLO model using CoreML.
    - `setConfidenceThreshold`: Sets the confidence threshold for detections.
    - `setIouThreshold`: Sets the IoU threshold.
    - `startCamera`: Starts the camera preview using AVFoundation.
    - `stopCamera`: Stops the camera preview.

---

## **7. Notes on YOLO Integration**

- The YOLO models are stored in the `assets/` directory and loaded dynamically at runtime.
- The plugin supports both CPU and GPU inference for better performance.
- Bounding boxes and detection results are rendered on the Flutter UI using custom painters.

---

## **8. Deploying Prebuilt App to iPhone**

- At the root of the `softball_tracker` folder you can locate the prebuilt app named `softball_tracker.ipa`
- Download the file to your Mac 
- Open xcode to a blank project
- Connect your device to your computer
- Open the `Devices and Simulator` window (window > devices and simulators)
- Under the section `Installed apps` hit the `+` at the bottom
- Locate your downloaded `softball_tracker.ipa` and select it
- On your iPhone navigate to `Settings > General > VPN & Device Management` and trust the app developer
- Open the app
